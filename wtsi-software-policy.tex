\section{The policy}
\label{policy}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Copyright assignment
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Copyright assignment}
\label{policy.copyright}
\par It is a condition of both employment and of holding visiting worker status at the 
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (the Institute) that software created in the course 
of work with the institute is considered work made for hire and must have 
copyright in the source code assigned to Genome Research Ltd (GRL) unless it 
falls under a general or specific exception (see \ref{policy.copyright.genexcept} and 
\ref{policy.copyright.specexcept}). 


\subsubsection{Scope}
\label{policy.copyright.scope}
\par This condition applies whether the employee or visiting worker (staff) 
created the software while physically located on the Institute's premises or 
elsewhere, whether using the Institute's equipment or other equipment, and 
whether the software is intended only for private use or is planned to be 
distributed to others (including being released publicly). GRL has a potential 
authorship interest in any software created in the course of work with the 
Institute, so unless staff are certain that software they develop falls 
under an exception, they are advised to either assign copyright in all software 
they write to GRL or to obtain a specific exception to retain or assign copyright 
otherwise.


\subsubsection{Responsibility to protect copyright}
\label{policy.copyright.protection}

\par Staff must respect the copyright interests of others, in particular when producing 
software which will fall under GRL copyright. 

\par Staff should take care not to infringe the copyright of others by taking their code 
and incorporating it into software under GRL copyright (whether by direct copying 
or some derivation or translation), unless:
\begin{enumerate}
\item it is allowed under the terms of a license offered by the copyright holders; and
\item all requirements of that license are met.
\end{enumerate} 

\par Due to a lack of a principle of fair use that applies world-wide, staff should not 
rely upon any fair use provisions of copyright law as the basis on which to 
incorporate the works of others into GRL copyrighted software. 

\par In addition, staff should not do anything to undermine the copyright position of GRL 
with respect to code to which they contribute as works made for hire. For example, 
staff are not permitted to dedicate works made for hire for the Institute into the 
public domain as that would undermine GRLs copyright interest in that work. 
Likewise, staff must not incorporate any code for which the copyright status is 
not clear into GRL copyrighted software. 

\par Staff should also keep records of the individual authors who have contributed to 
each source file in order to assist GRL with any legal challenges to the copyright 
status of the work (see \ref{bestpractice.records} for best practices in this regard). 


\subsubsection{General exceptions}
\label{policy.copyright.genexcept}
\begin{itemize}

\item Software completely unrelated to work with the Institute

\par If staff develop software in their free time which is not in any way connected 
with their work at the Institute or with the business of the institute, it would 
probably not be considered a work made for hire and therefore would not be 
subject to this policy. Whether or not a particular software project would or 
would not be considered a work made for hire is a complex legal question and 
is outside the scope of this policy. Staff who are uncertain whether software 
they are developing or have developed is a work made for hire should seek 
legal advice or obtain a specific exception (see \ref{policy.copyright.specexcept}) 
for the avoidance of any doubt. 

\item Small bug fixes and enhancements to third-party software

\par Staff may, in the course of their work, have occasion to modify software 
developed by third parties. It is often desirable that those changes be contributed 
back to the third party maintainer so that others can benefit from the modifications. 
In many cases, this can be done within the contraints of this policy by simply 
assigning copyright in the modified code to GRL and providing the modified code 
under one of the acceptable licenses \ref{policy.licenses}. 

\par However, in some cases the third-party may not be willing to accept contributions 
without assigning copyright to them (this is likely to be the policy in the case of 
corporate-owned software but is also common practice for many open source 
foundations, including the FSF). To make it easy for staff to contribute small 
changes back to the community from which we receive software, a general 
exception to the requirement to assign copyright to GRL is hereby granted for 
small contributions made for the purpose of fixing bugs, improving performance, 
or contributing minor enhancements to a third-party software package for which 
the maintainer would otherwise not accept the modified code contribution. 

\par In general, ``small'' contributions should consist of a set of relatively minor 
contributions that togehter should not consitute more than 100 lines of code 
and should not have taken more than one working day of development effort 
to produce. Several distinct contributions can be made by a particular staff 
member to a single piece of third-party software, but the combined total across 
all such contributions to that software package should still be considered small. 
In other words, there is a lifetime limit for each member of staff under this general 
exception to contribute up to 100 lines of code (or one working day of 
development effort) to each individual third-party software package, beyond 
which a specific exception should be obtained. 

\item Uncopyrightable code

\par This policy does not apply to code which does not rise to the level of a 
creative work or which would not be copyrightable for some other reason 
(such as having previously been dedicated into the public domain by the author). 

\par One example might be contributing extremely minor modifications to an existing 
codebase such as correcting minor spelling or syntax issues or adjusting whitespace. 
It could also include making the same extremely minor change repeatedly across a 
large number of lines and/or files, such as running a simple find-and-replace 
algorithm across an entire codebase to correct a typographical or spelling error. 
Generally, it is the degree of creativity involved and not the amount of code changed 
that determines whether a particular set of modifications is copyrightable. 

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Specific exceptions}
\label{policy.copyright.specexcept}

\par If a staff member wishes to develop software in the general area of his/her work 
but does not want to assign copyright to GRL, it should be discussed in the first 
instance with an IC member -- ideally before beginning work on the project. The IC 
member can then bring the request for a specific exception to the IC for a decision. 

\par Any staff member wishing to obtain a specific exception to the requirement to 
assign copyright to GRL must receive written permission from the IC before 
distributing any software outside the requirements of this policy. 

\par The written permission should indicate the specific work(s) and staff member(s) 
to which it applies as well as the organisation(s) or individual(s) to whom it is 
acceptable to assign copyright in that work in lieu of assigning it to GRL. An 
email from the IC secretary would suffice as written permission for the 
purposes of this policy, although it is also possible to get a signed letter from 
the \exectitle\ if that is required (e.g. for a third-party organisation's records). 


\subsubsection{Failure to comply}
\label{policy.copyright.failure}
\par Failing to comply with this policy may put the Institute's legal position with respect 
to its intellectual property at risk and may undermine our ability to protect the 
large investment we have made in software development, including the protection 
of works made available under free software licenses. 

\par In addition, distribution of software in a manner not consistent with this policy could be 
considered an infringement of GRL's copyright interest in the work (for which the 
Institute could seek damages). Worse, distribution of software including a copyright 
notice claiming a personal copyright or assigning copyright to another 
organisation when in fact the software is a work made for hire for the Institute may 
be considered a form of fraud (in which case anyone harmed by the false 
statement could potentially sue for damages, and for which one may even be subject 
to criminal prosecution in some jurisdictions). 




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Public release in advance of publication
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Public release in advance of publication}

\par Software which supports published work that is authored by GRL employees (e.g. 
software implementing methods described in a methods paper, software presented 
in an application note, software used in analysis and/or data processing for a 
research paper describing the results of those analyses and processing, etc.) should 
be made publicly available using an acceptable license (see \ref{policy.licenses} 
by the time of publication at the very latest. 




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Acceptable licenses
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Acceptable licenses}
\label{policy.licenses}
\par Our policy is that software under GRL copyright may be distributed outside of 
the Institute (including being made publicly available) under any free software 
license as defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). A rough definition of 
free software is that it gives the users 
``the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software'' 
but for a more complete definition, please refer to the FSF 
(\url{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html}). 
An incomplete list of free software licenses (which are acceptable) as well as 
nonfree software licenses (which are not acceptable) can be found at: 
\url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html}. Other licenses may be 
acceptable as well, provided they meet the requirements listed in the Free 
Software Foundation's definition. 

\par Prior to distributing a particular piece of software outside the Institute for the 
first time (including uploading code to public source control repositories such 
as \url{http://github.com/} or \url{http://sourceforge.net}), the original author(s) 
should, in conjunction with their line management, choose a free software 
license and apply it to the source code according to the best practices 
recommended for that particular license (see Appendix \ref{licenses} for a set 
of recommended licenses along with best practices for applying them). In 
general, if you 

\par Subsequent of a particular piece of software, staff must make all subsequent 
releases under the same license, unless that license would permit the public to 
redistribute the code under a different license (i.e. it is acceptable to change to a license 
compatible with the original license). Any staff member who wishes to do otherwise 
should apply to the IC for permission to release a piece of existing software under 
GRL copyright under a different license. Note that if software includes multiple 
copyright holders (e.g. GRL and another organisation), the license can only be changed 
to an incompatible license by unanimous agreement of all copyright holders. 

\par A significant advantage for staff members in releasing code under free licenses 
is that it guarantees indefinite access to their work, even if they move to another institute. 
There have been notable examples in academia where individuals have been unable 
to continue working on software that they wrote because of licensing restrictions, and 
this policy avoids that outcome by allowing all software to be made publicly available 
under a free software license.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation best practices}

%e.g. because you want to retain a copyright with a view 
%towards commercialisation, you wish to assign copyright to another organisation such 
%as an open-source software project  collaborator or your home institute, ), 
%
%In some cases, contributions to third-party open-source projects require copyright 
%disclaimers from employers be put on record before any code is accepted. 

%notes on how to assert copyright



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% How to indicate copyright
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{How to indicate copyright}
\par To assign copyright in software source code to GRL, a copyright notice should 
be included within its source code (normally within a comment block in the first 
few lines of each file). If a piece of software is comprised of multiple source code 
files, then each individual file must have a separate copyright notice. In order to 
not risk undermining the legal status of the copyright, it is a requirement that the 
copyright notice include the year(s) in which copyrightable contributions were 
made to the file, and it is important not to assert copyright for any year in which 
no copyrightable contributions were made to that file (because that could risk the 
copyright status of the whole file). The only exception to this is when starting a 
new file, it is acceptable to begin it with a copyright notice for the current year, in 
anticipation of the initial version of the file being created. This makes it easier to 
work with template headers that you can copy into place to start a new source 
file. If it later turns out that you don't make any copyrightable contributions until 
a later year, you should change the copyright notice to reflect the year(s) in which 
copyrightable contributions were actually made (i.e. replace the year from the 
template with the actual year when you created the initial file contents). 

\par The copyright notice should be of the form: 
\begin{verbatim}
Copyright (C) <YEARS> Genome Research Ltd.
\end{verbatim}

\par Where `\texttt{<YEARS>}' should include the list of years in which copyrightable 
contributions \cite{define:copyrightable} were made to the software. Each individual 
year should be listed separately. 

\par Whenever you modify an existing source file in a way which includes copyrightable 
contributions (e.g. adding more than a few lines of new code or substantially changing 
existing code), you must ensure that a Genome Research Ltd copyright notice is 
included in the file and that the year in which your modifications were created is 
listed in that notice. 

\par If an existing source file already contains a Genome Research Ltd copyright notice, this can be 
accomplished by simply appending the year in which your modifications were created 
to the end of the list of years in the existing copyright notice. If that year is already 
listed, you do not need to make any changes to the notice. 

\par If an existing source file does not contains any Genome Research Ltd copyright 
notice, you should add a new line following any existing copyright notices and 
including the year in which the modifications were created. If the existing source 
file contains no copyright notice, unless you are absolutely certain what the 
copyright status is of the work, you should assume it is actually copyrighted by 
someone unknown to you and therefore should not use it as to do so would risk 
infringing that unknown copyright when you distribute the combined work. One 
scenario in which no copyright notice would be present is if the work has been 
dedicated to the public domain by the author. In that instance, please ensure 
that a public domain dedication is present in the file. If you know 
that the file is in the public domain but it does not say so in the file (i.e. because 
you asked the author and received confirmation via personal communication), 
add a comment to the file indicating that portions of it are based on that earlier 
work which was placed into the public domain (give the name of the author and 
include a copy of their written public domain dedication). 

\par Please note that it is important to comply with the terms of license under 
which you received the original source file, and in some cases that may limit 
under which license(s) it is acceptable to distribute a combined work that 
includes that source code and your own code. In some instances, it is possible 
you may not be able to combine arbitary third-party code into a combined work 
without violating the licensing terms of one of them, so please be aware of any 
license restrictions before you start using any third-party source code or libraries. 
Note that it is possible to combine material available under multiple different 
third-party licenses provided they are all compatible \cite{define:compatible} with 
the license under which you distribute the combined work. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Individual authorship record
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Individual authorship record}
\label{bestpractice.records}
\par Each staff member who makes copyrightable contributions to a source file 
should include their own name in the file, usually on an ``Author'' line in the 
same comment block as the copyright notice and license text). In addition, it is 
good practice to use a source control system (such as git or svn) that allows 
individual line-level contributions to be attributed to specific individuals. 

\par The purpose of these records is twofold: 
\begin{itemize}
\item to assist with any legal challenges to the copyright status of the code within 
each file (see \ref{policy.copyright.protection})
\item to recognise the set of individuals who contributed to the work, in much the 
same way an author list on a peer-reviewed paper acknowledges the efforts of the 
researchers who worked on the paper
\end{itemize}

\par These records should never be modified except to correct 
errors, with the intention that they offer a faithful representation of the set of 
individuals who contributed to the work. 


\section{THIS IS THE END}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Choice of license
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Choosing between acceptable licenses}

All acceptable licenses considered here require the user of the code (referred to 
subsequently as the licensee) to maintain attribution and disclaimers in any versions of 
the code which they redistribute. The choice between alternative licenses depends on 
what additional obligations you wish to place on the licensee. There are three additional obligations to consider: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The licensee is additionally required to distribute any modified versions of the 
source code under the same license terms. 
\item The licensee is required to adopt the same license for any additional code that it 
is combined with to create a single piece of software. 
\item The licensee is additionally required to distribute the source code which 
corresponds to the version of the software running on a network server to all 
users interacting with the software remotely through a computer network (if the 
modified software supports such interaction) at no charge. 
\end{enumerate}

If the 1st and 3rd obligations are \textbf{not} required, a licensee is free to take the code, modify 
it and redistribute it under any terms that they wish, including commercially, only 
maintaining attribution and disclaimers to the original authors. This may not be a 
problem, since it does not interfere with any continued distribution of code by GRL, 
however it may mean external code improvements cannot be incorporated by GRL into 
its original code. Reasons for not requiring this obligation could be when you wish the 
code to be as widely adopted as possible, including within companies and when you do 
not fear a commercial competitor. The \textbf{Modified-BSD license} (as used by X11 
consortium) is appropriate in this case. Ensembl uses a variant of this license, which 
includes additional clauses related to the Ensembl name which is a registered trade 
mark. 
 
If the 1st obligation is required but the 2nd and 3rd obligations are \textbf{not}, a licensee is free 
to use the code as a component of a larger project but is free to distribute that larger 
project as a whole under what ever terms they wish. Choosing this combination of 
options is useful in cases where the project is a software library (e.g. biojava, bioperl) 
and the authors wish to ensure all library code is distributed under the same license, 
but want the library as a whole to be as widely used as possible, so do not want to 
restrict what software it is used as a component of. To enforce only the 1st obligation, 
the \textbf{LGPL license} is appropriate. This license obliges a licensee to enable the use of the 
licensee's program with whatever version of the LGPLed library a user sees fit, 
including one that that user has just modified themself. 

To enforce the 1st and 2nd obligation but not the 3rd, (such as is done by many high 
profile projects such as mysql and many self contained Sanger projects), the \textbf{GPL 
license} is appropriate. If your software provides user interaction over a network (such 
as an application with a web-based user-interface) then you may also consider requiring 
the 3rd obligation, in which case the \textbf{AGPL license} may be appropriate. Unless your 
project fits with one of the situations described above, the GPL (or AGPL) license is the 
most generally applicable license to use. It is also safe to use the AGPL on software that 
does not yet have any remote user interaction (e.g. a web interface) if you want to 
ensure that any future use of the software that does provide remote user interaction will 
be required to provide any modifications that have been made to your source code to 
the users of that service (this would not be required under the GPL if the modified 
version of your software is only run on a server but not distributed to others). 
 
The standard boilerplate header for each of these licenses is given in Appendix A, 
which in the case of LGPL, GPL and AGPL includes a link to the primary web site 
documenting the full license. Any of these licenses is acceptable as satisfying 
requirements above, so long as the copyright is assigned to Genome Research Limited 
and the author(s) names are given.

Given the legal nature of these boilerplate headers they must not be edited. If there is an 
additional license requirement that requires modification or addition to the text or the 
adoption of a different free software compatible license, this must be agreed with the 
IC first and in consultation with the \exectitle\ (\execperson).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Application of license
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Applying the license}

Once you have chosen the license you wish to use, you must apply the license so that 
people can see it. For software that is made available outside the Institute, at a 
minimum you must:

\begin{itemize}
\item state on webpages providing access to the software which license is applied 
\item provide the full text of the license in the root directory of any source code 
distribution (usually in a file called \filename{LICENSE.TXT}) 
\item insert the appropriate header (created from one of standard boilerplates given in 
the Appendix A) at or near the start of each separate source code file. Since these 
boilerplates are legal statements it is important that the text is not edited in any 
way beyond substituting the required names and dates.
\item provide the full text of the license in the root directory of any non-source project 
distributions (usually in a file called \filename{LICENSE.TXT}). 
\item provide basic documentation in the root directory of any source code 
distribution, and include all clauses found in Appendix B in that documentation 
(usually in a file called \filename{README.TXT}). 
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Old code
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Old code not conforming to these conditions}

Any code written by GRL employees or Sanger visiting/hosted scientists that is 
distributed on our web or ftp site should contain an approved header statement as 
outlined above. If there is no such copyright and licensing statement now, or what 
there is does not comply, then this policy should be applied and the code amended as 
appropriate. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% External projects
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Collaborations with others, and contributions to open source projects}

The following considerations apply when GRL employees or Sanger visiting/hosted 
scientists make substantial contributions to code maintained in collaboration with 
others outside the institute: 

\begin{itemize}
\item If the code is made publicly available under one of the standard acceptable open 
source licenses, or another license and header text that has been approved as 
described above, then again the line manager can approve contribution to the 
project, so long as a copyright statement is in place and the author's contribution 
is acknowledged. The copyright statement should include GRL as one of the 
copyright holders if a substantial fraction (say more than 25\% of the file) was 
written by a GRL employee or Sanger visiting/hosted scientist. 
\item If the code is developed as part of a research collaboration, and the software itself 
is a primary aim of the collaboration, then we would expect to require the 
software to be made widely available under an agreed license. If the 
collaboration is primarily about other matters, such as the generation and 
analysis of data, then it is acceptable for the software not to be distributed 
outside the collaboration, but even in this case a copyright statement and 
authorship attribution are required.
\item There may be cases where other arrangements are required, for example in 
collaborations with instrument manufacturers. In these cases a more formal 
agreement is required, which needs to be approved by the Director of Corporate 
Services who may consult the Wellcome Trust.
\item In some cases we use external software and either find and fix a bug, or make a 
useful modification, and want to feed that back to the author/copyright holder. 
Small bug fixes or enhancements of less than 100 lines or so of code are exempt 
from the provisions of this document. Larger contributions can also be made if 
authorised by an IC member. 
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Signing-off 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Contributions to open source projects that require ``signing off''}

Some open source projects require code to be ``signed-off'' with a declaration that says ``I 
wrote this code and am authorized to contribute it to the project'' (see section 5 in 
\url{http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html} for an example). The \exectitle\ (\execperson) can authorise code to be contributed in this fashion. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Policy scope
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Scope}

This policy applies to code you develop at work or at home when engaged in your 
work, whether on Sanger's or your own computer. If you wish to develop software in 
the general area of your work for which you wish to retain copyright with a view to 
commercialisation, you should discuss this beforehand with the Director of Corporate 
Services, or your IC member who would be expected to raise it with the Director of 
Corporate Services.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Commercialisation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Commercialisation of GRL software}

There are precedents where GRL software has been distributed under a commercial 
license, i.e. where payment has been received for use of the software. It is possible to 
distribute commercially software that is also available under an open source license, for 
example when someone wants to modify it and sell the modified version in a way 
incompatible with the open source license. If any GRL employee or Sanger 
visiting/hosted scientist wishes to pursue such a possibility, they should approach the 
Director of Corporate Services, keeping the IC informed. 


\appendix

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Appendix A: source code boilerplate
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Boilerplate headers for source code files}

The following are boilerplate headers that should be used, substituting DATES, PROGRAM-NAME, PROGRAM-AUTHOR and EMAIL as appropriate.

Note 1: The DATES in the copyright notice should be a comma-delimited list of years in which 
copyrightable contributions were made to the software. If and only if every year within a range 
of years really is a copyrightable year, you may choose to shorten such a range by using a `-' 
character between the first and last copyrightable years in the range. Multiple such ranges may 
be specified as elements of the comma-separated list, but it is also acceptable to list out each 
year individually. This line in the license should be updated every time a copyrightable 
contribution is made to the software. For example, if software was first written in 2005, then 
`2005' would be an appropriate value for DATES. If no substantial contributions were made 
during 2006, but new code was written in 2007, then DATES could be `2005, 2007' but should 
not be `2005-2007' since no copyrightable contributions were made in 2006. If a license file 
specified DATES as `2005, 2007-2009, 2011-2012' then the contributor would be equivalent to 
specifying DATES as `2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012' and it indicates that no copyrightable 
contributions were made in 2006 or 2010. It is important not to assert copyright for years in 
which no copyrightable contributions were made since this could undermine our rights to 
enforce the copyright. 
 
Note 2: Including the email address (EMAIL) is optional.

\section{Boilerplate to include in documention}

The following boilerplate should be included somewhere in the 
documentation distributed with the software. It need not be at the start of a 
file (which would be a good place to reiterate the name of the software, to 
describe what it does, and to describe where to find additional documentation 
on installation and use of the software), but must be included somewhere in 
the documentation. 

\begin{boilerplate}
\begin{verbatim}
The usage of a range of years within a copyright statement contained within 
this distribution should be interpreted as being equivalent to a list of years 
including the first and last year specified and all consecutive years between 
them. For example, a copyright statement that reads "Copyright (c) 2005, 2007-
2009, 2011-2012" should be interpreted as being identical to a statement that 
reads "Copyright (c) 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012" and a copyright 
statement that reads "Copyright (c) 2005-2012" should be interpreted as being 
identical to a statement that reads "Copyright (c) 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012".
